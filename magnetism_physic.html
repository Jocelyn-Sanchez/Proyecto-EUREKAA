<h2>The Earth's Magnetic Field</h2>
<p>
Generated by the movement of liquid iron in the outer core, Earth’s natural dynamo creates a protective field that
deflects most of the solar wind and keeps the atmosphere stable. Without this field, solar radiation would erode the
atmospheric layer.

<h2>The Magnetosphere</h2>
<p>
It is the region dominated by Earth's field where charged particles from the Sun interact. It regulates geomagnetic storms,
auroras, and magnetic reconnection phenomena.

<h2>Magnetism on the Sun</h2>
<p>
The Sun possesses highly dynamic fields that produce sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and complex coronal
structures. These emissions can affect satellites, power grids, and communications on Earth.

<h2>Magnetism in Interstellar Space</h2>
<p>
Galaxies and nebulae also contain magnetic fields that influence star formation and the behavior of interstellar plasma.
Their study is key to understanding large-scale cosmological processes.
