                On the morning of Friday, October 29, we conducted a very special interview with one of the most beloved and admired individuals in our institution: Engineer Ángel Pacheco Gutiérrez. The conversation was pleasant, interesting, and full of learning about science, engineering, and professional experience. Below, we present the interview:

                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                What type of engineering did you study, and what motivated you to choose that career?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "Great question. I studied Mechanical Industrial Engineering. What motivated me was that in high school I studied machines and tools, which gave me a foundation in mechanics. Also, due to financial reasons, I couldn’t study outside the region. I originally wanted to study Systems Engineering, but that program wasn’t available at the university; earlier, I had even thought about being an elementary school teacher, but my family didn’t recommend it. Since I’ve always liked math and physics, studying engineering was the most coherent choice."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                Based on your profession, what types of projects have you worked on, and which has been the most challenging?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "My career has a very solid foundation. In the 1980s I developed a liking for programming computers. By the time I finished my studies, I was already working creating engineering software. My thesis project consisted of a simulator to design power transmission shafts, allowing the calculation of diameters and gear positioning. That was my first industrial application. Later, I developed programs for regional companies and worked in the foreign trade area at the port of Veracruz, where I designed software to control the loading and unloading of containers. Later, I founded a software development company that has participated in numerous regional industrial projects."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                How do you apply mathematics and physics in your daily work?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "As a teacher, I apply this knowledge when teaching classes. In my professional work, I use mathematics to create algorithms that allow approximating results, analyzing curves, validating processes, and predicting behaviors. Methods such as differential calculus, integral calculus, and mathematical models are essential. Mathematics has always been a fundamental tool throughout my career."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                How do you think science influences people's daily lives?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "Without science we couldn’t live as we do today. Science has existed since humans discovered fire. It is present in everything: medicine, technology, industry, communication… absolutely every aspect of life. Even if we don’t always notice it, we depend on science daily."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                How do you think engineering can drive future generations both technologically and environmentally?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "Technology has always driven human development. In both technology and the environment, science is the engine behind the most important changes. To improve the environment, we need technology. If young people understand that science can improve their quality of life and care for the planet, they will seek innovative solutions that transform our future."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                Could you explain in simple terms a complex scientific concept within your field?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "A key concept in industrial engineering is forecasting. Forecasts allow us to know the probability of something happening. This is where statistics and data analysis come in. Statistics is simply a set of data from which we seek differences, patterns, or trends. It is a powerful tool for decision-making, and it’s one of the areas I enjoy the most."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                And finally, if you could be a scientist from any era, who would you choose and why?
                <br><br>
                <i>Engineer Pacheco:</i>
                "I would choose Newton. I deeply admire him for dedicating his entire life to science. He gave us differential calculus, one of the greatest contributions to humanity, in addition to formulating fundamental laws of physics."

               That same afternoon on Friday, October 29, we conducted another interview with the same previous questions, this time with a teacher who personally marked us with great lessons and many past generations as well—an excellent educator and 
               an extraordinary person. We are referring to Professor Carmen Mireya Venegas García. Without further ado, here is the interview:

                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                What type of engineering did you study, and what motivated you to choose that career?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "I have a degree in informatics. I would have liked to study systems engineering because in that field, in terms of informatics, both hardware and software are studied; in informatics we only study software, but that program didn’t exist in the region, so I couldn’t study it."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                Based on your profession, what types of projects have you worked on, and which has been the most challenging?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "The most challenging project for me was when I was asked to install a computer network in a company. It was around 15 computers. I had never developed a network before, so it was complicated for me. However, they gave me the manuals with a delivery deadline for the next day; they were all in English. By translating them with our knowledge, we managed to figure it out and develop the system—not in one day but in one month—leaving it well-established and working perfectly. It has been one of the biggest challenges for me because it was one of my first projects after leaving school." <br><br>
                <b><i>She told us a more recent anecdote in which she was asked to go to Acayucan to check a system, but since it was cyclone season, there was no transportation. They only offered her the service of a truck driver from that company who was leaving around midnight, so with great courage she dared to go under those conditions to solve the problem. Obviously, today she would not repeat that situation nor recommend it, but it was a challenging decision due to the circumstances.</b></i>

                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                How do you apply mathematics and physics in your daily work?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "Mathematics is applied when developing algorithms, flowcharts, and codes in which math is required, as it is an easier way to specify inputs, processes, and outputs to solve problems such as physics or math problems."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                How do you think science influences people's daily lives?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "Science is in everything. The other day I was listening to a chemistry colleague who asked where chemistry exists. It’s everywhere—from the moment we wash our face with water and soap, that’s chemistry, and there’s also physics at every moment—when we get up, in our food, in everything."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                How do you think engineering can drive future generations both technologically and environmentally?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "I believe it’s essential because currently AI has a lot of influence, so we must learn engineering fields. I mentioned that having an engineering degree plus a systems degree is a great idea for better job preparation."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                Could you explain in simple terms a complex scientific concept within your field?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "The solution to a problem. Scientifically, you must reach a solution through a methodology, conduct an information analysis, then design a possible solution, and in this case, it is achieved through programming for any type of problem—mathematical, physical, chemical, whatever it may be."
                <br><br>
                <i>Interviewer:</i>
                And finally, if you could be a scientist from any era, who would you choose and why?
                <br><br>
                <i>Professor Mireya:</i>
                "I admire Marie Curie for all her research and for being one of the first women scientists of her era. And a person I admire from our country is Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, for everything she developed—not only literature but as a person. In my opinion, regardless of everything she achieved, not necessarily a scientific discovery, her writing and teachings are also part of not only history but science."
