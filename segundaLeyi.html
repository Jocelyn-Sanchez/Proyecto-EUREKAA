                    The Second Law of Newton, or Fundamental Principle of Dynamics, is the second of the theoretical postulates formulated by the British scientist Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), based on previous studies by Galileo Galilei and René Descartes. Like his Law of Inertia, it was published in 1684 in his work Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, one of the fundamental works of modern physics. The law states in his original Latin text: 
                    “Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressæ, & fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur”
                    which means: “The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed.”
                    This means that the acceleration a given body experiences is proportional to the force applied to it, which may or may not be constant. The essence of this law is understanding that force is the cause of changes in motion and velocity.<br><br>

                    The Second Law of Newton of Motion, also known as the Fundamental Principle of Dynamics, establishes the crucial relationship among the force acting on an object, its mass, and the resulting acceleration. Unlike the first law, which describes what happens when there is no net force, the second explains what happens when an unbalanced net force exists: the object changes its velocity, meaning it accelerates.
                    The law can be summarized in the famous mathematical equation: (F = m · a). In this formula, F represents the net force (the sum of all vector forces acting on the body), m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration it experiences.
                    <br>
                    This relationship implies two key proportionalities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct proportionality between force and acceleration: The greater the net force applied to an object, the greater its acceleration. If we double the force, we double the acceleration, assuming mass remains constant.</li>
                        <li>Inverse proportionality between mass and acceleration: The greater the mass of an object (its inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by the same applied force. A much greater force is needed to move heavier objects with the same acceleration as lighter ones.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The Second Law of Newton is essential for measuring and calculating forces in the International System of Units. One Newton (N) is defined as the force required to produce an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared (1 m/s²) on a mass of 1 kilogram (1 kg).

                <h3>Formula of the Second Law of Newton</h3>
                <p>
                    The formula of Newton’s second law establishes that the force applied to a body is directly proportional to the acceleration that the body acquires. The mass of the body acts as the proportionality constant relating the applied force to the acceleration. <br>
                    The algebraic expression of Newton’s second law is:

                <p>
                    Where: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>F is the total force acting on the body or system. The unit of force in the International System is the Newton (N).</li>
                        <li>m is the mass of the body or system, its unit in the International System is the kilogram (kg).</li>
                        <li>a is the acceleration acquired by the body or system, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Note that all values must be expressed in the International System of Units for Newton’s second law to be valid.

                <h4>Examples of how to use it</h4>
                <p>
                    If a force of 145 N is applied to a 25 kg object, what acceleration does the object acquire?
                    <br><br>
                    To solve this problem, we must use Newton’s second law, which is:
                </p>
                <img src="fotos/formula6.png">
                <p>
                    Now we isolate acceleration:
                </p>
                <img src="fotos/formula7.png">
                <p>
                    Both the force and the mass are expressed in the International System of Units, so we only need to substitute the values into the formula and calculate the acceleration:
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, Newton’s second law is the fundamental principle of dynamics, providing the quantitative tools to predict how objects move in response to forces acting on them, and serving as the basis for much of modern physics and engineering.
