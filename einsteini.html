            <h2><i>Albert Einstein</i></h2>
        <p>
            The most famous scientist of the 20th century continues to maintain his charisma and legacy decades after his death.<br>
            Of Jewish origin, Albert Einstein (Ulm, Germany, March 14, 1879 – Princeton, United States, April 18, 1955) left behind 
            major theories, unforgettable quotes, and what is surely the most popular equation in the history of science: E=mc2. <br><br>
            Much to his regret, this formula paved the way for the development of the atomic bomb. A convinced pacifist, he always considered
            that urging President Roosevelt to finance nuclear research was one of the mistakes of his life.<br><br>
            Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, his discoveries left a mark in very diverse fields, and his predictions are still being confirmed even today. 
            The latest of them: gravitational waves. His status as a popular icon led him to even be offered the presidency of Israel, 
            an honor he declined, deeply moved.

            <h2><i>Early Life and Education</i></h2>
        <p>
            From a very young age, he showed great interest in science and mathematics, although his attitude toward formal education was problematic from the beginning. 
            Despite the popular myth that Einstein was a poor student, the truth is that he excelled in mathematics and physics; however, his rebellious personality 
            and rejection of authority and rules caused him trouble at school.
            As a young man, he was seen as distant and eccentric, something reflected in various aspects of his daily life; for example, he often dressed 
            carelessly and disliked formalities. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            While working at the patent office, Einstein carried out his research in parallel with his job, independently and without the support
            of a university or any institution. His work soon caught the attention of the scientific community, and he began to gain recognition. <br><br>
            As a result of the impact of these publications, Einstein obtained the long-desired position of university professor. In the following years, he worked at 
            various European institutions, mainly in Switzerland but also in Czechoslovakia and Germany. He accepted a position at the prestigious Prussian Academy 
            of Sciences in Berlin, and Emperor Wilhelm II himself invited him to direct the Physics Department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, predecessor of the 
            Max Planck Institute. Despite how much it had cost him to obtain his academic post, from then on he began to focus on his research, leaving teaching aside. <br><br>
            During the 1920s, partly thanks to the fame brought by winning the Nobel Prize, Einstein spent much time traveling and giving lectures in Europe, the United States, and Asia. <br><br> 
        </p>

        <p>
            In his final years, although his active presence in theoretical physics had diminished with the rise of new generations of scientists, Einstein
            remained active in the academic world, received multiple awards, and maintained correspondence with some of the most important scientists of his time.
            Until his death in 1955, he continued working on his physics studies and reflecting on the nature of the universe. His scientific legacy remains 
            fundamental in modern physics and in our understanding of the cosmos.

        <h2><i>Albert Einstein’s Most Important Contributions</i></h2>
        <article>
            <h2>Special Theory of Relativity (1905)</h2>
            <p>
               In 1905, Albert Einstein published his famous article “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” a work that definitively transformed modern physics.
               In it, he questioned the classical Newtonian view, which assumed the existence of absolute space and time, independent of the observer’s motion. <br><br>
               Einstein proposed a new structure for the physical universe, based on simple yet profoundly revolutionary principles. 
            </p><br><br>
            <h4>Fundamental Ideas</h4>
            <p>
                Special Relativity is based on two postulates that change the way we understand physical reality.
                <ul type="square">
                <li>First: It argues that there is no “absolute time”: time does not flow the same for everyone; instead, it depends on each observer’s state of motion.</li>
                <li>Second: It establishes that the speed of light in a vacuum —approximately 300,000 km/s— is constant and the same for any observer, regardless of whether they are moving toward or away from the light source.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To these two principles, another essential element is added: the laws of physics must be identical for all observers who are not undergoing acceleration, meaning all those in uniform rectilinear motion.

            <h3>Photoelectric Effect (1905)</h3>
            <p>
                One of Albert Einstein’s most revolutionary works, for which he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, was his explanation of the photoelectric effect. This discovery not only solved a mystery of physics at the time but also laid the foundation for quantum mechanics. <br><br>
                The explanation of the photoelectric effect was pioneering for the development of quantum mechanics, as it confirmed that energy could be quantized. It also had crucial technological applications such as solar panels and photographic sensors.

            <h3>General Theory of Relativity (1915)</h3>
            <section>
                <section class="tarjeta">
               <p>
                <i>"Matter curves spacetime, and objects move by following that curvature."</i>
               </p>
            </section>
               <p>
                In 1915, after a decade of intense work, Albert Einstein presented the General Theory of Relativity, a completely new formulation of gravity that replaced the classical Newtonian view. While 
                Newtonian gravitation described gravity as a force acting instantaneously at a distance between masses, Einstein proposed a radically different framework: space and time are not rigid and passive stages, 
                but dynamic entities that can be deformed.
               </p><br><br>
               <h4>Central Idea</h4>
               <p>
                General Relativity holds that gravity is not a force in the traditional sense, but a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. In this model, objects do not “feel” 
                a force pushing or pulling them; instead, they move along natural paths —geodesics— within a curved spacetime. The greater the mass of an object, the more intense the curvature it generates, influencing how 
                other bodies move and even how time flows.<br><br>
                General Relativity is now one of the fundamental pillars of modern physics. Its equations govern contemporary cosmology, allowing us to understand the expansion of the universe, the formation of galaxies, and the dynamics of the most extreme objects in the cosmos.
                This theory transformed our understanding of the universe, showing that space, time, matter, and energy form a deep and interconnected reality on a large scale.

            <h3>Contributions to Quantum Physics (1917)</h3>
            <p>
                One of his most notable contributions was stimulated emission, which describes how a photon can induce an excited atom to emit another identical photon with the same energy, frequency, and direction. This principle is the theoretical basis of the laser, a fundamental technology 
                in medicine, telecommunications, barcode readers, and many other advanced devices. <br><br>
                Together with Indian physicist Satyendra Bose, Einstein developed Bose–Einstein statistics (1924–1925), which describe how bosons distribute themselves, particles that can occupy the same quantum state. From this, he predicted a new state of matter, the Bose–Einstein condensate, 
                in which a group of bosons behaves like a single “super-atom.” This state was experimentally observed in 1995, opening an innovative field in ultracold matter physics and quantum optics. <br><br>
                Additionally, Einstein strengthened the understanding of the wave–particle duality of light, demonstrating that photons can behave simultaneously as particles and waves. This concept is key in modern quantum optics and in the manipulation of photons for advanced sensors,
                quantum computing experiments, and technologies based on light–matter interaction. <br><br>
                Einstein’s contributions to quantum mechanics were fundamental to modern science and technology, showing that even with his reservations about the probabilistic interpretation of the theory, his work enabled the development of theories and applications that are essential 
                in physics and everyday life today.

           <h2><i>The story behind the photo of Einstein sticking out his tongue</i></h2>
           <p>
            With his tongue out and sitting in a limousine next to his wife. That’s how a persistent paparazzi captured the photograph of Einstein that would go around the world. It happened on March 14, 1951, when the scientist was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton 
            (USA) celebrating his birthday with his colleagues. Tired, Einstein left the party intending to go home, but a journalist didn’t want to miss the opportunity and took the photograph. We all know the famous scientist’s reaction. <br><br>
            Did you know this story? <br>
