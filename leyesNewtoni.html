                    Throughout the history of science, few contributions have had as deep and lasting an impact 
                    as the Laws of Motion formulated by Isaac Newton in 1687 in his work 
                    *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica*. These three laws constitute the core of 
                    classical mechanics, a branch of physics that describes how and why objects move under the 
                    action of forces.

                    Newton's Laws provide a quantitative description of motion and allow us to predict 
                    trajectories, calculate accelerations, design machines, build vehicles, and understand 
                    natural phenomena, from the movement of a ball to the orbital motion of planets.

                <p>
                    More than three centuries later, these principles remain present in education, engineering, 
                    and modern technological development. Their study reminds us that science models reality 
                    through observation, experimentation, and the formulation of universal laws.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The Laws of Motion were formulated by Isaac Newton in the 17th century, a time of enormous 
                    scientific progress. Before him, thinkers like Aristotle proposed ideas about motion based 
                    on assumptions rather than experimental evidence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1687 Newton published his work *Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*, where 
                    he established the foundations of classical mechanics. His theory allowed for the first time 
                    the precise mathematical prediction of the motion of objects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The laws are summarized in three principles: inertia, the relationship between force and 
                    acceleration, and action-reaction. These concepts transformed science and remain essential 
                    to modern physics.

                <h3>First Law of Newton</h3>
                <p>
                    The law of inertia states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform straight-line 
                    motion unless acted upon by a net force.

                <h3>Second Law of Newton</h3>
                <p>
                    The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied and 
                    inversely proportional to its mass. In other words: the greater the force, the greater 
                    the acceleration.

                <h3>Third Law of Newton</h3>
                <p>
                    “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” When one object exerts a 
                    force on another, it responds with an equal force in the opposite direction.
