    <h2>What is magnetism?</h2>
    <img src="fotoss/mag.png" alt="Image" with="300">
    <p>
        Magnetism is a fundamental interaction of nature that arises from the presence of moving electric charges 
        and the quantum properties of subatomic particles. It manifests as forces of attraction and repulsion 
        between materials, as well as the generation of invisible fields capable of influencing matter at a distance.
        On a physical level, magnetism is an inseparable part of electromagnetism, mathematically described by 
        Maxwell’s equations. These principles establish that electric and magnetic fields are not separate entities, 
        but rather different aspects of the same phenomenon that propagates through space in the form of 
        electromagnetic waves, which include light, radio waves, X-rays, and many others.
        Magnetism exists on both microscopic scales — in the spins of electrons — and colossal scales, such as 
        the Earth's magnetic field, solar magnetism, or the fields generated in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Thanks 
        to magnetism, essential technologies such as motors, generators, transformers, hard drives, sensors, satellites, 
        and navigation systems function.

<section>
    <h2>Microscopic origin of magnetism</h2>
    <p>
        The deeper origin of magnetism lies in the structure of the atom. Electrons have a quantum property 
        called <b>spin</b>, which acts as a tiny magnet with its own magnetic moment. In addition, the 
        orbital motion of each electron around the nucleus also generates a magnetic field. The combination of 
        these two effects determines how atoms interact with external fields.
        In many atoms, electrons group into pairs with opposite spins, canceling their magnetic moments. 
        However, in some elements such as iron, nickel, or cobalt, unpaired electrons remain whose magnetic 
        moments align collectively, allowing the existence of ferromagnetism.
        Quantum physics explains that alignment occurs when electrons of different atoms interact through what is 
        known as “quantum exchange,” a phenomenon that cannot be described with classical physics but is crucial 
        to understanding why a material can become a permanent magnet.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of magnetic behavior</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Diamagnetism:</b> 
            All materials exhibit it to some degree. It arises when an external field induces microscopic currents 
            that generate an opposing field. It is extremely weak but universal, even observed in materials such as 
            water or copper.
        </li>

        <li><b>Paramagnetism:</b> 
            Occurs in materials whose atoms have magnetic moments that do not completely cancel. In the presence 
            of a field, these moments tend to align, increasing the field’s intensity. Paramagnetic materials include 
            aluminum, sodium, and liquid oxygen, which displays very notable paramagnetic effects due to its molecular structure.
        </li>

        <li><b>Ferromagnetism:</b> 
            Characterized by the formation of magnetic domains, regions where the magnetic moments of billions of 
            atoms are aligned. The energy required to maintain this order is very low, allowing the existence of 
            permanent magnets. Ferromagnetism is crucial for industry, digital storage, and the manufacturing of motors.
        </li>

        <li><b>Antiferromagnetism:</b> 
            In these materials, magnetic moments align in opposite directions, canceling each other out. Although 
            externally they appear non-magnetic, they are very important in spintronics, sensors, and advanced 
            memories such as MRAM.
        </li>

        <li><b>Ferrimagnetism:</b> 
            Similar to antiferromagnetism but with unequal magnetic moments, producing a resulting field. Ferrites 
            are widely used in antennas, transformers, wireless chargers, and radio-frequency devices.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2>Fundamental laws of magnetism</h2>

    <p>
        The mathematical description of magnetism was developed over centuries and consolidated in the 19th century 
        through the work of Maxwell, Ampère, Faraday, and Biot–Savart. Each of these laws explains both the generation 
        of magnetic fields and their interaction with moving charges and materials.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Biot–Savart Law:</b> describes how an electric current produces a magnetic field in space. 
            It is essential for calculating the field around wires, coils, and solenoids, enabling the design of 
            motors, superconducting magnets, and transformers.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Ampère’s Law:</b> states that the magnetic field around a conductor is proportional to the 
            current intensity. In its Maxwell-extended version it includes the concept of displacement current, 
            key to understanding how light propagates in a vacuum.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Faraday’s Law:</b> a change in magnetic flux produces an electromotive force (voltage). It is the basis 
            of electrical generation, from small dynamos to giant hydroelectric or wind turbines.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Lorentz Force Law:</b> explains the force experienced by a moving charge within a magnetic field. 
            This law allows the operation of electric motors, particle accelerators, and plasma confinement devices 
            such as tokamaks.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Maxwell’s Equations:</b> unify electricity and magnetism into a single theoretical framework. They also 
            predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of light, demonstrating that 
            light is a manifestation of electromagnetism.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Magnetism on Earth (geomagnetism)</h2>
    <img src="fotoss/mages.jpg" alt="Geomagnetism image" width="300">
    <p>
        The Earth's magnetic field originates in the outer core, a layer of liquid iron and nickel that moves by 
        convection due to the planet’s internal heat. This movement, combined with Earth’s rotation, generates a 
        dynamo effect that produces a global magnetic field extending tens of thousands of kilometers into space.
        Geomagnetism protects Earth from the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles emitted by the Sun. 
        Without this natural shield, the atmosphere would have been eroded, as happened on Mars billions of years 
        ago according to studies by NASA and ESA. In addition, geomagnetism enables navigation using compasses, 
        influences animal migration, and is essential to space weather studies, which examine how solar variations 
        affect Earth.
    </p>

    <h3>Associated phenomena</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Magnetosphere:</b> 
            A theoretical region surrounding the planet that deflects much of the solar wind. It has an elongated 
            shape due to the pressure of the solar particle flow and is the site of complex processes such as magnetic 
            reconnection.
        </li>

        <li><b>Auroras:</b> 
            The northern and southern lights occur when solar particles penetrate the magnetosphere and collide with 
            oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. These collisions excite the atoms, which release light when 
            they return to their normal state, producing the luminous displays typical of polar regions.
        </li>

        <li><b>Magnetic reversals:</b> 
            Throughout Earth’s history, the north and south magnetic poles have swapped positions many times. The 
            geological record shows hundreds of reversals, studied through paleomagnetism, which help scientists 
            understand core dynamics and plate tectonics.
        </li>

        <li><b>Anomalies:</b>
            There are regions where the magnetic field is weaker or stronger than usual. The most studied is the 
            South Atlantic Anomaly, where the magnetosphere is closer to the surface, affecting low-orbit satellites 
            and requiring temporary shutdowns of sensitive instruments.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Magnetism in the Sun and space</h2>
    <p>
        The Sun is a gigantic natural laboratory of magnetic physics. Its magnetic field is thousands of times stronger 
        than Earth’s in certain regions and is organized in complex structures such as coronal loops, filaments, and 
        sunspots. The twisting and reconnection of field lines produce explosive phenomena such as solar flares 
        and coronal mass ejections, capable of releasing massive amounts of energy in minutes.
        These events are studied by NASA, ESA, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), as they can affect 
        communication systems, GPS, satellites, and Earth’s power grids. On cosmic scales, magnetic fields play roles 
        in star formation, galaxy dynamics, and relativistic jets from black holes.
    </p>

    <h2>Measurement of magnetism</h2>
    <p>
        The unit of measurement for magnetic field strength in the International System is the tesla (T), although the 
        gauss is also used in astronomical and historical contexts. Earth's magnetic field ranges between 
        25 and 65 microteslas, while a common magnet can exceed 0.1 teslas, and superconducting magnets used in 
        magnetic resonance imaging can reach 3 to 7 teslas.
        Precise measurement of magnetism is carried out using a variety of specialized instruments:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Proton magnetometers:</b> used in geophysics to measure the field with great stability and precision.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>SQUID sensors:</b> superconducting devices capable of detecting extremely weak fields, even those of 
            biological origin.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Fluxgate magnetometers:</b> used in space satellites, such as ESA’s Swarm mission, to map the Earth’s 
            magnetic field.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Magnetoresistive sensors:</b> widely used in electronics, digital compasses, and mobile phones.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Current problems and modern research</h2>
    <p>
        Modern research in magnetism covers very broad fields, from quantum physics to astrophysics. 
        Space agencies and research centers continuously monitor solar activity and Earth’s magnetic field 
        because of the importance of space weather for modern society. Induced currents from solar storms can 
        damage transformers, interrupt communications, and affect satellites.
        Scientific missions such as <b>Swarm</b> (ESA) and <b>DSCOVR</b> (NOAA–NASA) provide precise data on changes 
        in Earth’s magnetism. Technologically, research in “spintronics” seeks to manipulate electron spin 
        to create faster and more efficient devices than those based on electric current.

        advanced transportation systems, medical equipment, and communication technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Current research continues to reveal new aspects of magnetism, both in materials and in solar and 
        space plasmas. From scientific satellites monitoring the magnetic field, to particle accelerators and 
        research in spintronics and superconductivity, magnetism remains a key area for science and engineering. 
        Understanding it allows not only explaining natural phenomena but also developing more efficient, safe, 
        and sustainable technologies for the future.
