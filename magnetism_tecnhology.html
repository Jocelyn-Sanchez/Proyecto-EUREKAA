<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Magnetism is the foundation of numerous technologies that enable the operation of electrical systems, transportation,
medicine, digital storage, and communications. Its application is essential in modern society.

<h2>Technological Applications</h2>
<h3>Motors and Generators</h3>
<p>
They operate through the interaction between magnetic fields and electric currents. Motors convert electricity into
movement, while generators do the opposite.
</p>
<h3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h3>
<p>
It uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate internal images of the human body. It is indispensable for
diagnostic medicine.
</p>
<h3>Magnetic Levitation Trains (Maglev)</h3>
<p>
They employ superconducting electromagnets to levitate and propel trains at speeds above 500 km/h without mechanical friction.
</p>
<h3>Magnetic Storage</h3>
<p>
Hard drives, magnetic tapes, and cards use magnetic layers to store information in the form of oriented domains.
</p>
<h3>Industrial Electromagnets</h3>
<p>
Used to lift heavy metals, separate materials, and operate machinery in industrial environments.
