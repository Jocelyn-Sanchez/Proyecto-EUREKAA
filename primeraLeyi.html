                    Newton’s first law is general and can be applied to anything: from an object sliding on a table to a satellite in orbit or blood being pumped by the heart. Experiments have verified that any change in velocity (speed or direction) must be caused by an external force. The idea of universal laws or laws of general application is important: it is a basic characteristic of all laws of physics.
                    Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns in nature from which other patterns can be discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first developed the idea of the first law of motion, and of Newton, who clarified it, was to pose the fundamental question: "What is the cause?" Thinking in terms of cause and effect is fundamentally different from the typical approach of ancient Greece, when questions such as "Why does a tiger have stripes?" would have been answered in an Aristotelian way, such as "that is the nature of the beast". The ability to think in terms of cause and effect is the ability to establish a connection between an observed behavior and the surrounding world.

                    The First Law of Newton, commonly referred to as the Law of Inertia, is a fundamental pillar of classical physics and establishes the relationship between an object's state of motion and the absence or presence of external forces. This law states that any object will persist in its state of rest or uniform straight-line motion unless a net external force acts upon it and forces it to change that state.
                    <br><br>
                    The law introduces the idea of an inertial frame of reference. In an inertial system, when the vector sum of all external forces applied to an object is zero (ΣF = 0), the acceleration is zero (a = 0). This may mean the object is at rest or moving at constant velocity. It is a state of translational equilibrium.
                    <br><br>
                    There are numerous practical applications: from everyday phenomena to aerospace engineering. For example, in outer space an object will continue moving indefinitely in a straight line at constant velocity. On Earth, friction and air resistance usually stop objects. A common example is a passenger who, when a car brakes, continues moving forward due to inertia.

                <h3>Formula of the First Law of Newton</h3>

                <p>
                    To further explore the concept of Newton’s first law, this section shows the formula used to express this law.
                    <br><br>
                    Mathematically, the formula states that if the sum of forces in a system is equal to zero, the acceleration is also zero. The reverse is also true.

                <img src="fotos/formula1.png">

                <p>Likewise, if the sum of forces is zero, it implies that the momentum (or linear momentum) is constant.</p>

                <h4>Examples of how to use it</h4>

                <p>
                    What is the force an elevator must exert to lift an object of 7 kg?
                    <br><br>
                    The first step is to calculate the gravitational force that Earth exerts on the object using the weight formula:

                <p>
                    Then, according to Newton’s first law, if the elevator exerts an upward vertical force of 68.67 N, the object will remain still because the resultant force will be zero. Therefore, the elevator must exert a force greater than 68.67 N for the object to begin to rise.
