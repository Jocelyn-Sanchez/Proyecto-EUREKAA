            <p>
                On March 20, 1727 of the Julian calendar (March 31 in the Gregorian calendar, then in force in England), Sir Isaac Newton died. A few days later, he was buried in Westminster Abbey in a funeral attended by practically all the intellectuals and much of the aristocracy of Great Britain.
                <br><br>
                A tribute was paid to a man of science, a mathematician, a natural philosopher, and the first scientist to be knighted by the queen in the history of that country. At the time of his death, he was president of the Royal Society, a member of the Longitude Commission, and his influence flowed through all channels of British culture. A guest at the funeral, coming from France and known as Voltaire, was surprised that British society honored the figure of a scholar.
                Isaac Newton died in his eighties with the reputation of possessing an extraordinary mind capable of mastering the most difficult sciences: mathematics and calculus, the mechanics of celestial bodies, and the behavior of light. In fact, his contemporaries admired him so much that they could not contain their exaggerations.

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>
                The man who died considered a universal sage was born on December 25, 1642 (according to the Julian calendar used in England at the time; January 4, 1643 in the modern Gregorian calendar) in Woolsthorpe, a village in Lincolnshire, England, into a Puritan English family. His childhood was not happy: his father died before he was born, and at the age of three his mother left him with his grandmother to marry an Anglican clergyman. When he was eleven years old, his mother became widowed again and returned to him.
                <br><br>
                He attended King’s School in Grantham, where he showed aptitude for mechanics, building models and windmills. At age 18, in 1661, he entered Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he studied under the system of the time, based mainly on the works of Aristotle. However, the young Newton soon became interested in more modern ideas from philosophers such as René Descartes, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei. He graduated in 1665 without particular distinctions.

            <h2>The Making of a Genius</h2>
            <img src="fotoss/royal.png" class="imagen-extra">
            <p>
                Newton was trained during the years in which the scientific revolution triumphed throughout Europe, linked to authors such as Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Borelli, Hobbes, Gassendi, Hooke, and Boyle, whose works he studied carefully. Newton began as a follower of Descartes, as did anyone interested in renewing natural philosophy and mechanics.
                <br><br>
                In particular, the power of Descartes’ mathematics fascinated scientists of that generation, including Newton. But unlike others, Newton had his own way of thinking and did not allow himself to be carried away even by a philosophy as attractive as that of Descartes. Thus, already in the 1660s, he criticized the Cartesian conception of motion in his writings and developed an alternative theory on the nature of light and colors.
                <br><br>
                In 1672 Newton joined the Royal Society, an institution founded in London in 1660 that brought together the leading English scientists, and that same year he presented before its members a memoir titled New Theory about Light and Colors, in which he explained the relationship between white sunlight and the colors of the rainbow. Earlier scholars, such as Descartes and Huygens, believed that true light was white light, formed by particles that spread in waves. Colors, in turn, were considered properties of the surfaces on which light struck.
                <br>
                However, through a series of experiments carried out with prisms, Newton concluded that colors were properties of the light itself, and that white light was simply the combination of rays of different colors. Light was therefore not the result of the vibration of any material ether, but a substance with its own properties.
                <br><br>
                These ideas displeased Robert Hooke, an influential member of the Royal Society who had devoted all his efforts to developing the theses of Descartes and Huygens. His harsh criticism of Newton’s memoir created between them an enmity that would last for decades. Newton never forgave Hooke, withdrew to Cambridge, cut his ties with the Royal Society, and only formally returned as its president in 1703, the year of Hooke’s death.
                <br><br>
                Resentful and relentless, Newton rushed to erase all traces of Hooke’s work in the Royal Society, including his portraits. In 1704 he published his Opticks, written in English, which presented his corpuscular interpretation of light — a triumph over English Cartesians of the time.

            <h2>The Masterpiece: Principia Mathematica</h2>
            <img src="fotoss/NewtonsPrincipia.jpg" class="imagen-extra">

            <p>
                Although Newton had developed his ideas about gravitation and motion years earlier, he did not publish them immediately. It was the astronomer Edmond Halley who, after discussing them with Newton in 1684, encouraged him to formalize and publish his work. The result was *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, published in 1687, widely considered the most important scientific work ever written.
                <br><br>
                In the *Principia*, Newton formulated his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. These laws explained not only the fall of objects on Earth but also the motion of planets and comets in space, unifying terrestrial and celestial physics under a single set of mathematical principles and providing the first precise description of gravity.

            <h2>Later Years and Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Besides his scientific work, Newton was a man of many interests. He devoted a significant amount of time to alchemy and theological studies. He also had a notable public career:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>He was elected a member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge on two occasions.</li>
                    <li>In 1696, he moved to London to assume the position of Warden and later Master of the Royal Mint, where he successfully supervised the great recoinage of English currency, fighting counterfeiters with great zeal.</li>
                    <li>In 1703, he was elected president of the prestigious Royal Society, a position he held until his death.</li>
                    <li>In 1705, Queen Anne granted him the title of Sir, becoming Sir Isaac Newton.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Isaac Newton died in London on March 20, 1727 (March 31 in the Gregorian calendar) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His legacy is immense; his laws of motion and universal gravitation dominated physical science for more than 200 years, laying the foundations for modern engineering and science and culminating in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.
