<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Magnetic materials are substances whose electronic structure allows interaction with external magnetic fields.
Their behavior depends on the alignment and response of the atomic magnetic moments, which determines whether the material
is ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, diamagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or antiferromagnetic.

<h2>Classification of Magnetic Materials</h2>
<h3>Ferromagnetic</h3>
<p>
They present a strong alignment of magnetic domains. They are used in permanent magnets, motors, transformers, and
electronic devices. Iron, nickel, and cobalt are the main examples.
</p>
<h3>Paramagnetic</h3>
<p>
They respond weakly to magnetic fields due to the partial orientation of their unpaired electrons. Their magnetization
is proportional to the intensity of the external field.
</p>
<h3>Diamagnetic</h3>
<p>
They oppose magnetic fields by generating induced fields in the opposite direction. All materials possess some
degree of diamagnetism, although it is usually very weak.
</p>
<h3>Ferrimagnetic</h3>
<p>
They have opposing magnetic moments that do not completely cancel out. Ferrites—widely used in antennas, inductors, and
magnetic memory—belong to this category.
</p>
<h3>Antiferromagnetic</h3>
<p>
Their atomic magnetic moments align in opposite directions, almost completely canceling each other. They are important in advanced
research and spintronics technologies.
