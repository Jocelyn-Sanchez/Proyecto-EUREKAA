                    <p>
                        The electromagnetic spectrum is immensely vast, ranging from radio waves with wavelengths the size of buildings to gamma rays with wavelengths smaller than an atom. However, visible light—the only portion our eyes can detect—represents only a tiny fraction of this entire range. If the electromagnetic spectrum were a highway stretching from coast to coast, the part visible to us would be no more than a small pedestrian crossing.
                        <br>
                        Our visual capability is limited to wavelengths between approximately 380 and 700 nanometers (from violet to red). This limitation is due to the biology of our eyes and their evolution, adapted to perceive sunlight that predominates on the Earth's surface. Other creatures can see beyond this; for example, bees can see ultraviolet light, and some snakes detect infrared heat, giving them a perception of physical reality very different from ours.
